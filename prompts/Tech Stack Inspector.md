# Tech Stack Inspector

Describe me the tech stack used based on the following HTML document:

{{browser-tab format="html"}}

Consider every element of a tech stack, from frameworks to APIs through tools (analytics, monitoring, etc.). Include which fonts are used. Don't make any guesses on what’s used if there’s no evidence.
