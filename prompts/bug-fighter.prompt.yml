      The code is missing a check to make sure `page` is greater than 0 before subtracting 1. Otherwise, the page could be set to -1 which might cause unexpected behavior.

      ```
      function PrevAction() {
        const [page, setPage] = useGlobalState("page");
        return (
          <Action
            title="Go to Previous Page"
            onAction={() => setPage(Math.max(page - 1, 0))}
          />
        );
      }
      ```
