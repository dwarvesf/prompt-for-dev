      Transform the following natural language requests into valid SQL queries for the target database: {{target_database}}. Assume a database with the following tables and columns exists:

      {{schema}}

      Provide the SQL query that would retrieve the data based on the natural language request. Do not reply with anything else other than SQL, but do wrap the query in backticks (```sql ... ```).

      Request: {{input}}
